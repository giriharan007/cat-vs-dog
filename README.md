# cat-vs-dog-image-processing-model
An image processing model which uses deep learning algorithm to differentiate between a cat and a dog

<h1>Building the model</h1>
<h3>libraries needed:</h3>
1. Tensorflow
2. Opencv
3. os
4. Numpy
5. Random

<h3>Dataset:</h3>
Dataset downloaded from kaggle

<h3>Model Working:</h3>
The model works by allowing a kernel matrix to move over the image.
As the kernel matrix moves it detects the edges of the cat or the dog.
The model is trained using previously fed data by using the above feature and during this process the model has a label associated with every image.
After training the model can now be used to predict random images taken from any platform.
